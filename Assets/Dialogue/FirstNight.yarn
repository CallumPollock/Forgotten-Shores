Trevor: Hey, <b><color=blue>{$name}</b></color>, wait!
Trevor: Have you been preparing for your first night? How did it go?

<<if $isPrepared>>
Trevor: Well done, you look prepared. But don't take it for granted, the night will still be rough.
<<else>>
Trevor: Hmm... I fear you have not taken this seriously enough.
Trevor: You should work towards crafting a <color=blue><b>Stone Sword</b></color> at least.
<<endif>>

Trevor: Once night falls the <b><color=blue>monsters</b></color> will rise.
Trevor: Look, I'd stay but I have... matters to tend to. See you later.
